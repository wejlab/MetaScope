\usage{
metascope_id(
  bam_file,
  aligner = "subread",
  NCBI_key = NULL,
  out_file = paste(tools::file_path_sans_ext(bam_file), ".metascope_id.csv", sep = ""),
  EMconv = 1/10000,
  EMmaxIts = 25,
  num_species_plot = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bam_file}{The .bam file that needs to be summarized, annotated, and
needs removal of ambiguity.}

\item{aligner}{The aligner which was used to create the bam file. Default is 
"subread" but can also be set to "bowtie" or "other"}

\item{NCBI_key}{(character) NCBI Entrez API key. optional.
See taxize::use_entrez(). Due to the high number of
requests made to NCBI, this function will be less prone to errors
if you obtain an NCBI key.
You may enter the string as an input or set it as ENTREZ_KEY in .Renviron.}

\item{out_file}{The name of the .csv output file. Defaults to the bam_file
basename plus ".metascope_id.csv".}

\item{EMconv}{The convergence parameter of the EM algorithm. Default set at
\code{1/10000}.}

\item{EMmaxIts}{The maximum number of EM iterations, regardless of whether
the EMconv is below the threshhold. Default set at \code{50}.
If set at \code{0}, the algorithm skips the EM step and summarizes the .bam
file 'as is'}

\item{num_species_plot}{The number of genome coverage plots to be saved.
Default is \code{NULL}, which saves coverage plots for the ten most
highly abundant species.}
}
\value{
This function returns a .csv file with annotated read counts to genomes with
mapped reads. The function itself returns the output .csv file name.
}
\description{
This function will read in a .bam file, annotate the taxonomy and genome
names, reduce the mapping ambiguity using a mixture model, and output a
.csv file with the results. Currently, it assumes that the genome
library/.bam files use NCBI accession names for reference names (rnames in
.bam file).
}
\examples{
#### Align reads to reference library and then apply metascope_id()

## Assuming filtered bam files already exist

## Subread aligned bam file

## Create object with path to filtered subread bam file 
bamPath <- system.file("extdata","subread_target.filtered.bam",
package = "MetaScope")

## Run metascope id with the aligner option set to subread
metascope_id(bam_file = bamPath, aligner = "subread")

## Bowtie aligned bam file 

## Create object with path to filtered subread bam file 
bamPath <- system.file("extdata","bowtie_target.filtered.bam",
package = "MetaScope")

## Run metascope id with the aligner option set to bowtie
metascope_id(bam_file = bamPath, aligner = "bowtie")

## Different or unknown aligned bam file

## Create object with path to unknown origin bam file 
bamPath <- system.file("extdata","subread_target.filtered.bam",
package = "MetaScope")

## Run metascope id with the aligner option set to other 
metascope_id(bam_file = bamPath, aligner = "other")
